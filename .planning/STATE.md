## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: React 19 + Vite 8 + Supabase + Tailwind v4 + Vercel (no custom backend)
- Auth: Shared UUID URL is the only credential — no account creation
- RLS must be enabled before any data is written (Phase 1 task, not retrofit)
- Subscribe-before-fetch pattern required for Realtime (Phase 4)
- Mobile Safari WebSocket reconnection handling must be designed in Phase 4, not added later

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RLS exact policy syntax for list_id scoping needs to be pinned during Phase 1 planning
- Who-added-this attribution mechanism (localStorage device ID) needs to be clarified during Phase 2 planning
